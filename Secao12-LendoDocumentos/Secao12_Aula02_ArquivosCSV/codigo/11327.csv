When you purchase a vehicle with the CARFAX Buyback Guarantee, you're getting what you paid for. This 2015 Ford Mustang has great acceleration and wonderful styling without sacrificing exceptional fuel economy. It's not a misprint. And the odometer isn't broken. This is a very low mileage Ford Mustang. A rare find these days. More information about the 2015 Ford Mustang: The 2015 Mustang may still have one of the most recognizable names in the automotive world, but with its latest redesign, it's become far more than just a pretty face and a familiar name. It now represents one of the best value propositions for buyers who just want the fastest car for their money. There is no longer a slow Mustang and a fast Mustang, there are just fast and even faster versions. The Mustang starts at $23,600, a price that undercuts most of its less powerful rivals, such as the Subaru BRZ. Even when optioned out beyond the $40,000 mark, the Mustang still represents a tremendous deal, with performance that excels relative to that higher price point as well. Interesting features of this model are powerful engines, sporty handling, modernized styling, available as a convertible, improved fuel economy, and Mustang

Drive home in your new pre-owned vehicle with the knowledge you're fully backed by the CARFAX Buyback Guarantee. There is no reason why you shouldn't buy this Lexus ES ES 350 FWD. It is incomparable for the price and quality. Beautiful color combination with Satin Cashmere Metallic exterior over Parchment w/Birds Eye interior making this the one to own! More information about the 2017 Lexus ES: The Lexus ES occupies an important niche within the highly competitive entry-level luxury segment. With its attractive sheetmetal, long list of standard features, and incredible safety technologies the ES earns its high recommendations. While the Lexus is much more comfort-oriented than entries from Cadillac and Mercedes, it does so extremely well, and for a price that starts just under $40,000. The Lexus ES 300h hybrid version provides all the luxury but aims to save fuel with a gasoline/electric powertrain. Lexus and Toyota are credited with essentially inventing the modern hybrid and the ES utilizes that technology to its fullest, earning a combined EPA estimated 40 mpg.

This 4WD-equipped vehicle handles any condition on- or off-road with the sure footedness of a mountain goat. With unequaled traction and stability, you'll drive with confidence in any weather with this Blue Flame Metallic 2012 4WD Ford F-150 4WD SuperCrew 145 SVT Raptor. This vehicle has extremely low mileage on the odometer, so while it's pre-owned, it's practically new. More information about the 2012 Ford F-150: Ford claims class-leading fuel economy, as well as best-in-class towing and horsepower for both its base V6 engine as well as both of the available V8s. Ford also says that it's the only automaker to offer a 6-speed automatic transmission across its entire model lineup. The F-150 is also the only full-size pickup so far to offer electric power steering, which saves fuel and gives an improved steering feel. Across the lineup, the F-150 carries through with the full redesign that the truck received for 2009; since then, the F-150's very purposeful, upright instrument panel and vastly upgraded interior materials have stood out in this very competitive class. And with the new 36-gallon fuel tank, the F-150's 750-mile driving range puts it in a class by itself. Interesting features of this model are class-leading towing and payload capacities, wide range of models for all budgets, tastes, and needs, available luxury features, fuel efficiency, and Smooth, strong new powertrain

More information about the 2015 Ford Mustang: The 2015 Mustang may still have one of the most recognizable names in the automotive world, but with its latest redesign, it's become far more than just a pretty face and a familiar name. It now represents one of the best value propositions for buyers who just want the fastest car for their money. There is no longer a slow Mustang and a fast Mustang, there are just fast and even faster versions. The Mustang starts at $23,600, a price that undercuts most of its less powerful rivals, such as the Subaru BRZ. Even when optioned out beyond the $40,000 mark, the Mustang still represents a tremendous deal, with performance that excels relative to that higher price point as well. Strengths of this model include powerful engines, sporty handling, modernized styling, available as a convertible, improved fuel economy, and Mustang
